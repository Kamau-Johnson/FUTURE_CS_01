# FUTURE INTERNS CYBER SECURITY REPORT

## Task 4: Vulnerability Assessment Report
As part of my Cyber Security Internship at Future Interns, I conducted an in-depth Vulnerability Assessment to identify potential security flaws, analyze risks, and recommend effective countermeasures.

# Key Highlights of the Assessment:
✔ Security Scanning – Used OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Nmap to detect vulnerabilities.
✔ Threat Analysis – Investigated SQL Injection, XSS, IDOR, and security misconfigurations.
✔ Network Security Review – Evaluated exposed services, weak authentication, and open ports.
✔ Remediation Planning – Proposed MFA enforcement, secure coding, WAF integration, and penetration testing.

## Tools Used:
🔹 OWASP ZAP – Identified web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection & XSS.
🔹 Burp Suite – Analyzed session hijacking, authentication weaknesses & open redirects.
🔹 Nmap – Scanned network services to detect open ports & database exposure risks.

## Skills Developed:
✔ Security Scanning & Testing – Hands-on experience with automated & manual vulnerability analysis.
✔ Threat Impact Assessment – Evaluated risks and their potential impact on systems & data.
✔ Cybersecurity Best Practices – Recommended secure authentication, encryption, and firewalls.
✔ Incident Prevention Strategies – Strengthened security posture through patching & monitoring.

## Why This Project Matters?
Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, making vulnerability assessments essential in safeguarding digital assets. Through this project, Future Interns gain:
✅ Real-world exposure to penetration testing & risk assessment.
✅ Critical thinking in identifying & mitigating cyber threats.
✅ Experience in network security & secure application development.

## Conclusion:
The Vulnerability Assessment Report provided valuable hands-on experience in analyzing system weaknesses, improving security controls, and implementing proactive defense strategies. By continuously enhancing security measures, organizations can significantly reduce cyber risks and ensure a safer digital environment.
