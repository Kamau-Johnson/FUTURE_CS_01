# FUTURE INTERNS CYBER SECURITY REPORT

## Task 4: Vulnerability Assessment Report  
As part of my Cyber Security Internship at Future Interns, I conducted an in-depth Vulnerability Assessment to identify potential security flaws, analyze risks, and recommend effective countermeasures.

## Key Highlights of the Assessment  
**Security Scanning** – Used OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Nmap to detect vulnerabilities.  
**Threat Analysis** – Investigated SQL Injection, XSS, IDOR, and security misconfigurations.  
**Network Security Review** – Evaluated exposed services, weak authentication, and open ports.  
**Remediation Planning** – Proposed MFA enforcement, secure coding, WAF integration, and penetration testing.

## Tools Used  
**OWASP ZAP** – Identified web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS.  
**Burp Suite** – Analyzed session hijacking, authentication weaknesses, and open redirects.  
**Nmap** – Scanned network services to detect open ports and database exposure risks.

## Skills Developed  
**Security Scanning & Testing** – Hands-on experience with automated and manual vulnerability analysis.  
**Threat Impact Assessment** – Evaluated risks and their potential impact on systems and data.  
**Cybersecurity Best Practices** – Recommended secure authentication, encryption, and firewalls.  
**Incident Prevention Strategies** – Strengthened security posture through patching and monitoring.

## Why This Project Matters  
Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, making vulnerability assessments essential in safeguarding digital assets. Through this project, Future Interns gain:  
- Real-world exposure to penetration testing and risk assessment.  
- Critical thinking in identifying and mitigating cyber threats.  
- Experience in network security and secure application development.

## Conclusion  
The Vulnerability Assessment Report provided valuable hands-on experience in analyzing system weaknesses, improving security controls, and implementing proactive defense strategies. By continuously enhancing security measures, organizations can significantly reduce cyber risks and ensure a safer digital environment.
